<li>Project 1:  HHC Vaccination Correlation to CDC Reporting Influenza-Like-Illnesses (ILI)
<p><b>Is there a corelation between vaccination rates and rates of influenza?</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Problem:</b>  During the recent flu season, the effectiveness of the vaccine was questioned?</li>
<li><b>Hypothesis:</b>  If the vaccine is effective, then states with high vaccination rates will have low influenza rates.</li>
<li><b>Test:</b>  Compare vaccination rates from Health and Human Services (HHS) and compare them to the rates of influenza from the Center of Disease Control (CDC).</li>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
There have been recent concerns regarding flu vaccinations, flu outbreaks, and supplies of flu shots.
</p>
<p>
The purpose of this project is to determine if the flu vaccinations were effective against the influenza of this year, thus mitigating recent concerns.
<p>The Center Disease Control (CDC) publishes "PERCENTAGE OF VISITS FOR INFLUENZA-LIKE-ILLNESS REPORTED BY SENTINEL PROVIDERS" 
from their "FluView" website (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html).
</p>
<p>
The Health and Human Resources (HHS) publishes "trends: vaccination rates for an entire flu year" from their "HHS Flu Vaccination API" website (https://fluvaccineapi.hhs.gov).
</p>
<p>
If the vaccine were effective, states with low vaccination rates should have high influenza rates.  Conversely, states with high vaccination rates should have low influenza rates.  
</p>
<p>
The HHS source will be plotted against the CDC source.

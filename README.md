<li>Project 1:  Health and Human Services (HHS) Vaccination Rates Correlation to CDC Reporting of Influenza-Like-Illnesses (ILI)
<p><b>Is there a correlation between flu vaccinations and flu-like-illnesses?</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Problem:</b>The public may lose confidence in flu vaccinations and may stop being vaccinated because of this.</li>
<li><b>Hypothesis:</b>High vaccination rates should result in lower rates of influenza-like illnesses.</li>
<li><b>Test:</b>  Compare recent tweets to government data to determine if there is a correlation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is to determine if the flu vaccinations were effective against the influenza of this year, thus mitigating recent concerns.
<p>The Center Disease Control (CDC) publishes "PERCENTAGE OF VISITS FOR INFLUENZA-LIKE-ILLNESS REPORTED BY SENTINEL PROVIDERS" 
from their "FluView" website (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html).
</p>
<p>
The Health and Human Resources (HHS) publishes "trends: vaccination rates for an entire flu year" from their "HHS Flu Vaccination API" website (https://fluvaccineapi.hhs.gov).
</p>
<p>
If the vaccine were effective, states with low vaccination rates should have high influenza rates.  Conversely, states with high vaccination rates should have low influenza rates.
